This list includes the 30 most recommended books to read at least once in your life, covering both classics and relatively new titles. If you’ve read all 30 of them (which is not entirely impossible), feel free to leave your comments, we definitely want to hear from you! Some of them are really super long series like Wheel of Time or simply a short story from a series of collection. The majority of them are classics, but they’re up here on the list for many reasons for sure as they’re not only adopted within a to-read list by the general public but also have been thoroughly utilized in various educational system.

From George Orwell, John Steinbeck, Kurt Vonnegut to J. R. R. Tolkien, you’ll find lots of options to choose from. The best part in our opinion in this list is that the titles are always worth re-reading even if you’ve read it before. There are so many plots, characters, narrations, descriptions and additional background stories that it’s quite probably that we might have missed that on our first read.
